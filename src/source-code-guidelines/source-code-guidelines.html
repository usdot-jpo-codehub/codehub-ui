                        <p>The mission of the Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO) is to lead “collaborative and innovative research, development, and implementation of intelligent transportation systems to improve the safety and mobility of people and goods.” To further this mission, the ITS JPO is committed to providing timely access to ITS-related source code to support third-party research, evaluation, and application development in order to maximize the ITS JPO’s investments in research initiatives.</p>
                        <p>These guidelines build on broader federal, United States Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) and industry policies and best practices to inform the development, publishing, reuse and management of ITS-related source code. These broader policies and best practices include, but are not limited to:
                            <ul>
                                <li><a id="m-16-21_fscp" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'m-16-21','m-16-21_fscp')">The Federal Source Code Policy (FSCP)</a></li>
                                
                                <li><a id="US-DOT-source-code-management-memo" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'departmental-source-code-management', 'US-DOT-source-code-management-memo')">The U.S. DOT Departmental Source Code Management Memo</a></li>
                                
                                <li><a id="code-dot-gov_1" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'code-dot-gov', 'code-dot-gov_1')">Code.gov</a></li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>The goal of these guidelines is to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Decrease time from research to insight for ITS-related source code by harnessing the power of the community for problem solving and innovation</li>
                                <li>Ensure ITS-related source code is discoverable, interoperable, and developed iteratively and in the open when possible</li>
                                <li>Ensure ITS-related source code has a path to sustainable deployment and maintenance</li>
                                <li>Enhance source code management and reuse</li>
                                <li>Achieve cost savings on ITS projects</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>Note that in accordance with the FSCP, before funding a project for custom-developed source code the U.S. DOT must conduct a <a id="three-step-software-solutions" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'m-16-21', 'three-step-software-solutions')">Three-Step Software Solutions Analysis</a>. Custom-developed source code, the focus of these guidelines, should only be acquired or developed when this analysis results in the discovery of no existing federal or commercial code to fulfill a need by the U.S. DOT. If custom-developed source code is required, the use of hybrid solutions is encouraged.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="scope">2. Scope</h3>
                        <p>These guidelines apply to all research projects funded, either fully or partially, by the ITS JPO. This includes projects run by federal employees with ITS JPO funds, any new awards, and any new funding agreements. While these guidelines do not apply retroactively, we strongly encourage making custom-developed source code available as open source to the extent possible under existing projects. The ITS JPO may choose not to incorporate these guidelines for specific research projects, such as those not collecting or creating source code. Where ITS JPO enterprise software investments produce custom-developed source code, ITS JPO Program Managers are encouraged to follow these guidelines to enable discovery and reuse of that code.</p>
                        <p>These guidelines do not bind the public, except as authorized by law or as incorporated into a federal project, contract, grant, or other agreement.</p>

                        <h3 id="audience">3. Audience</h3>
                        <p>These guidelines are to be used by ITS JPO Program Managers and U.S. DOT personnel dealing with contracts, grants, or other agreements as standards for projects producing ITS-related source code, as well as by project teams when creating and publishing ITS JPO-funded source code. A project team is an organizational entity or individual involved with a research project creating custom-developed source code for the ITS JPO. A project team may include, but is not limited to, federal staff, contractors, grantees, and researchers.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="access">4. Access</h3>
                        <p>Consistent with federal policy (e.g. the <a id="m-16-21_fscp_2" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'m-16-21','m-16-21_fscp_2')">Federal Source Code Policy</a>), all federally-funded, custom-developed source code must be made publicly accessible and developed in the open unless a specific intellectual property, privacy, security or other valid restriction on public access is identified. For a full list of exceptions see Section 6 of the <a id="m-16-21_fscp_3" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'m-16-21', 'm-16-21_fscp_3')">Federal Source Code Policy</a>. Project teams must make explicit reference to any perceived exemptions from public accessibility and/or open development in solicitation, funding agreement, project, and supplemental documentation for ITS JPO review. Where valid restrictions exist, project teams must make source code and associated documentation adhere to as many open source and open development principles as possible. This may include making a redacted version of the source code publicly accessible and/or using an incremental release schedule. At a minimum, controlled access to source code and associated documentation necessary to achieve core research goals must be provided to the U.S. DOT. Source code determined not to be subject to the aforementioned exceptions must be open source and developed in the open by default.</p>
                        <p>All federally-funded, custom-developed source code must be listed in the U.S. DOT's enterprise source code inventory and made available in the federal catalog (<a id="code-dot-gov_2" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'code-dot-gov','code-dot-gov_2')">www.code.gov</a>). For assistance with onboarding source code to <a id="code-dot-gov_3" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'code-dot-gov', 'code-dot-gov_3')">Code.gov</a>, especially for source code that is made accessible on <a href="#" route-href="route:popular">ITS CodeHub</a>, project teams can contact <a id="dontact-us-email" href="mailto:data.itsjpo@dot.gov">data.itsjpo@dot.gov</a>.</p>
                        <p>When made accessible, source code must be available in an open format that is platform independent, machine-readable, and available to the public for free and without restrictions that would impede the reuse of the source code. The priorities of open source, open format and development in the open should be reflected in solicitation, funding agreement, project, and supplemental documentation.</p>
                        <p>Source code must include the use of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). Final research results must also include the use of Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) numbers, the creation and maintenance of a research project record in the Transportation Research Board’s (TRB) Research in Progress (RiP) database, and the timely and complete submission of all required publications and associated source code. Additional information about how to comply with the guidelines can be found at: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">https://ntl.bts.gov/public-access/how-comply<img src="/img/external-link-alt-hover_darkGray.svg" class="external-link-icon-in-paragraph" alt="External link icon"></a>. The ITS JPO will assist awardees in compliance with these broader U.S. DOT guidelines.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="rights-and-ownership">5. Rights & Ownership</h3>
                        <p>The ITS JPO uses <a id="far-52227" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'rights-in-data-general', 'far-52227')">FAR 52.227-14</a> in contracts and <a id="2cfr" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'intangible-property','2cfr')">2 C.F.R. 200.315</a> in grants to acquire rights to data (source code) for the government. As a default position, the ITS JPO will obtain unlimited rights to all federally-funded, custom-developed source code subject to specific negotiations. Per the <a id="m-16-21_fscp_4" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'m-16-21','m-16-21_fscp_4')">Federal Source Code Policy</a>, at a minimum, for all custom-developed source code the U.S. DOT must obtain rights to Government-wide reuse and rights to modify the source code. If any specific exemptions persist as specified in the <a id="m-16-21_fscp_5" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'m-16-21','m-16-21_fscp_5')">Federal Source Code Policy</a>, these must be made clear by the project team. Project teams must detail all claims and associated rationale for limiting the government's rights in solicitation, funding agreement, project, and supplemental documentation.</p>
                        <p>Per federal guidance, project teams must also apply open licenses to federally-funded, custom-developed source code so there are no restrictions on the use, disclosure, reproduction, preparation of derivative works, distribution of copies to the public, performance publicly and display publicly, in any manner and for any purpose, and to have or permit others to do so. For more information about open licenses, including which license a project should assign, see the ITS JPO’s 
                           
                            <a target="_blank" href="#" route-href="route:templates-and-guides">
                            Open License Guide - Source Code</a>.
                             </p>
                        <p>The ITS JPO requests that users of federally-funded, custom-developed source code disclose its lineage and notify the ITS JPO of its use, but maintain no legal right to require disclosure or notification.</p>

                        <h3 id="storage-and-retention">6. Storage & Retention</h3>
                        <p>Source code must be stored in a system that provides an appropriate level of user access, functionality, and source code management. The source code storage system(s) the project team intends to use must be made clear in solicitation, funding agreement, project, and supplemental documentation. A source code storage system should encourage iterative and open source development and enable sustainable deployment and maintenance of source code. The system should be interoperable with widely-adopted open source version control standards to encourage development in the open and ease future platform integrations and migrations. Additionally, the system should have a vibrant user community to provide feedback on and make contributions to the source code.</p>
                        <p>Project teams may use different systems to store different types of source code (e.g public, non-public). The ITS JPO encourages using source code storage systems with significant adoption by the open source community. If the ITS JPO determines that a proposed source code storage system does not provide an appropriate level of user access, functionality and source code management, the project team must propose a new system for approval by the ITS JPO. Wherever possible, these determinations must be made prior to award. When using open source community systems, project teams should follow community documentation standards. If there is a discrepancy between the community documentation standards and this guidance, any issues should be resolved before award.</p>
                        <p>Source code, associated metadata, and user documentation subject to these guidelines must be retained and made accessible to the ITS JPO (subject to ITS JPO-approved exemptions) for a minimum of five years. This retention period begins when the ITS JPO either receives or creates the source code, associated metadata and/or user documentation.</p>

                        <h3 id="standards">7. Standards</h3>
                        <p>To promote interoperability of source code across platforms and users, all ITS JPO-funded source code should use open standards. All ITS JPO-funded source code and associated documentation must be <a id="section508-gov_1" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'section508-gov','section508-gov_1')">508-compliant</a> to allow reuse and evaluation of the source code by users with disabilities. </p>
                        <p>The ITS JPO will issue a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for ITS JPO-funded projects without one to make the project more citable and shareable. A DOI should be referenced in the Post-Award Source Code Management Plan (README).</p>

                        <h3 id="security-and-privacy">8. Security & Privacy</h3>
                        <p>Consistent with federal and U.S. DOT policy (e.g., <a id="fips-pub-199_1" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'fips-pub-199','fips-pub-199_1')">FIPS 199</a>, <a id="sp-800-37_1" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'sp-800-37', 'sp-800-37_1')">NIST SP 800-37</a>, <a id="dot-order-1351-37_1" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'dot-order-1351-37','dot-order-1351-37_1')">DOT Cybersecurity Policy</a> and <a id="dot-departmental-cybersecurity-compendium_1" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'dot-departmental-cybersecurity-compendium','dot-departmental-cybersecurity-compendium_1')">DOT Departmental Cybersecurity Compendium</a>), all U.S. DOT and U.S. DOT contractor information systems that generate, store, process, transfer, display, or communicate information must be protected at a level commensurate with the potential impact of a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability on the U.S. DOT’s operations, assets, or individuals. This includes information systems that store ITS JPO-funded source code. As such, commensurate security specifications or requirements must be incorporated into solicitation, funding agreement, project, and supplemental documentation.</p>
                        <p>To test the proper implementation of these requirements, ITS JPO-funded source code is subject to a security code review. Project teams must use <a id="software-assurance-metrics-and-tool-evaluation_1" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'software-assurance-metrics-and-tool-evaluation','software-assurance-metrics-and-tool-evaluation_1')">source code analysis tools</a> or comparable means to analyze the code and/or compiled versions of code and detect and report weaknesses that can lead to security vulnerabilities. A Program Manager may impose a third-party review of the project team's source code. The results of all source code reviews are presented to the Authorizing Official for the associated information system. After source code review, a penetration test should not discover any additional vulnerabilities in the source code.</p>
                        <p>If source code is developed that will collect, store, or process sensitive information (e.g., personally identifiable information (PII),  confidential business information (CBI), etc.), project teams must work with the Program Manager and relevant modal offices (e.g, Modal Privacy Office, etc.) to identify, evaluate and mitigate risk in accordance with relevant policy and guidelines (e.g., <a id="dot-order-1351-18_1" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'dot-order-1351-18','dot-order-1351-18_1')">DOT Privacy Risk Management Policy</a>, etc.) and to ensure that project risk management obligations are upheld. Source code development must adhere to industry best practices, specifically to not include sensitive information including usernames, passwords, and non-public internet protocol (IP) addresses. The project team must report actual or suspected incidents of sensitive information handling, including breaches and violations, in accordance with relevant policies and guidelines (e.g., <a id="dot-order-1351-19_1" href="#" click.trigger="moveToTag($event,'dot-order-1351-19','dot-order-1351-19_1')">DOT Order 1351.19 PII Breach Notification Controls</a>, etc.).</p>

                        <h3 id="documentation">9. Documentation</h3>
                        <p>Project teams must include all documentation required by the above guidelines, as well as any documentation that will aid in successful source code management. This includes, but is not limited to:
                        </p>
                        <h4 id="source-code-management-plan">Source Code Management Plan (Preliminary Documentation)</h4>
                        <p>Project teams must include a Preliminary Source Code Management Plan (SCMP) in their proposal, or for intramural projects prior to the beginning of the project, that summarizes how they will comply with these guidelines. The U.S. DOT will use the information in the preliminary SCMP as part of its evaluation criteria for award and may ask for clarifications or changes from the project team prior to award to ensure the U.S. DOT and/or public receives appropriate access. The preliminary SCMP must provide a preliminary overview of source code that may be created through the project, and include the following:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Project Description</li>
                                <li>Intended purpose of the source code and description of what the source code does</li>
                                <li>Plan for the overall structure of their source code and what source code storage system(s) the project team intends to use</li>
                                <li>Expected engagement level (i.e. how frequently the community can expect activity)</li>

                            </ol>
                        </p>

                        <p>The Preliminary SCMP will evolve into the Post-Award SCMP, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/usdot-jpo-codehub/codehub-readme-template">README<img src="/img/external-link-alt-hover_darkGray.svg" class="external-link-icon-in-paragraph" alt="External link icon"></a>, and should be maintained in the same location(s) the source code is stored.</p>
                        <p>The SCMP must demonstrate the project's full compliance with these guidelines and all applicable U.S. DOT and federal policies and guidance.</p>

                        <h4>Post-Award Documentation</h4>
                        <p>During the period of performance, project teams must also include the following documentation to be maintained in the same location(s) the source code is stored. All documentation must use plain language.</p>
                        <p>A Post-Award SCMP (README) file updated at least every six months. The Post-Award SCMP should be based on the preliminary SCMP, providing more information as it becomes available as well as:
