# codehub-ui
> version: 3.2

# Project Description
This repository holds the frontend user-interface (UI) code for the United States Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) Joint Program Office (JPO) Intelligent Transit Systems (ITS) CodeHub website located at [https://its.dot.gov/code](https://its.dot.gov/code).

# Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Containerization Platform - Version 19.03 (or higher)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript Runtime Environment
- [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/) - JavaScript Web Application Framework
- A running instance of the [CodeHub API](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-codehub/codehub-api) (and therefore ElasticSearch)
- A running instance of the [Constant Contact API](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-codehub/cdh-apicc)
- A running instance of [Codehub UI Image Server](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-codehub/codehub-ui-image-server)

# Usage
The CodeHub UI is a Dockerized application. While it is possible to run this application natively, we strongly recommend that you use Docker to abstract away the complications of Node version management and package installation.

## Installing

The UI requires a running CodeHub API instance to which it can connect. See the [codehub-api repository](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-codehub/codehub-api) for instructions.

After you have the CodeHub Web API and Constant Contact API running, you may run the CodeHub UI in Docker using the following steps:

1. Set the `PROXY_PASS_WEBAPI` environment variable to the following: `proxy_pass "PROTOCOL://URL:PORT";` where the protocol is http or https, URL is the location of your CodeHub Web API, and port is the port it is running on.
2. Set the `PROXY_PASS_APICC` environment variable to the following: `proxy_pass "PROTOCOL://URL:PORT";` where the protocol is http or https, URL is the location of your Constant Contact API, and port is the port it is running on.
2. Run the `./build-and-run-docker.sh` script present in the top level of this repository.

## Testing
### Running Unit Tests

Unit tests are run via the aurelia-cli and use [karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) and [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) as test-runners.

#### To execute the unit tests, execute the following command:

```shell
au test
```

#### To execute the unit in a Test Driven Development (TDD) mode:

```shell
au test --watch
```

### Running Integration Tests

Integration tests are performed with [Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/).

1. Place your E2E-Tests into the folder ```test/e2e/src```
2. Install the necessary webdriver.

  ```shell
  gulp webdriver-update
  ```

3. Configure the path to the webdriver by opening the file ```protractor.conf.js``` and adjusting the ```seleniumServerJar``` property. Typically its only needed to adjust the version number.

4. Make sure your app runs and is accessible

  ```shell
  au run
  ```

5. In another console run the E2E-Tests

  ```shell
  au protractor
  ```

## Execution
Deployment of the UI is similar to running in Docker locally, you must set the two proxy pass environment variables.

**Important:** if the CodeHub Web API or the Constant Contact API are running behind load balancers, you will need to set their proxy pass environment variables using the nginx resolver directive, as follows:

```shell
export PROXY_PASS_WEBAPI='resolver 10.0.0.2 valid=10s; set $backend "http://example-loadbalancer.amazonaws.com:3000"; proxy_pass $backend;'
export PROXY_PASS_APICC='resolver 10.0.0.2 valid=10s; set $backend "http://example-loadbalancer.amazonaws.com:3000"; proxy_pass $backend;'
```

Where 10.0.0.2 is the location of your network's domain name server (10.0.0.2 is the default for an AWS VPC with the default 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR), and the example-loadbalancer is the URL and port of your API's load balancer.

Run "npm start serve" at your root codehub-ui repo.
